## Before You Start

Hello and welcome to the Mod 1 Assessment! Before we continue, we want to ground you in the fact that the goal of this assignment is to help *you*. This is not about grades, it's about finding out what you know and if you still need help in some areas. Attempt as *many* questions as you can, some code is always better than no code!

Whenever you take an assessment, you may be flustered. The first step is to count 15 seconds. This feels *unbearably* long in the moment and a waste of precious time! But remember, you have thousands and thousands of seconds. You know how each one felt like forever? Then that means you have a ton of time to work. Breathe in and let the adrenaline rush hit you, and then let it subside so you can *focus*.

We recommend reading over all prompts before your start working. There may be things you know right off the bat, and filling them out first can help you feel more confident. Nothing here is linear, and everything can be done in whatever order you prefer.

Some other helpful things:

- This is open book, open note, open documentation, open console. Use your resources (not AI).
- If you're not sure what a question is asking, reach out to an instructor.
- DO NOT DWELL ON ANY SINGLE QUESTION. If you're stuck, move on and come back to it later.

Good luck everyone!

## Set Up Your Repository

Before starting, run the following commands to install dependencies and create your draft branch.

```
npm i 
git checkout draft
```

When you are done, push your commits to the `draft` branch of GitHub and create a pull request. For a refresher on this process, check out the [Marcy Docs on how to submit an assignment](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/how-tos/working-with-assignments#how-to-work-on-assignments).

## Grading

Every short response question will be given a score from 0-3 using the following scoring system:

* 0 — Did not attempt the question
* 1 — Attempted the question and the response is more wrong than right, or parts of the question are not fully answered, or the answer is lacking in clarity. Examples and/or diagrams are missing (when required).
* 2 — Attempted the question and all parts of the question are answered, but there are some mistakes and/or the clarity could be improved. Examples and/or diagrams may be missing or could be improved.
* 3 — Answered the question correctly and completely. The response is clear and concise. Examples and/or diagrams are well-chosen and enhance the response.

We understand that typos and grammar mistakes can happen, however, you will also lose .5 points on any the question where typos or grammar errors are "distracting". Distracting meaning that if you saw this on the job, it would have to be retyped for clarification or for the sake of presentation.

## Feedback

To support you in your growth as a technical communicator, your instructor may also provide feedback on the following areas:

**Clarity**: The communication is precise, concise, and unambiguous. Technical jargon is explained, and terms are used consistently.

**Completeness**: The communication covers all necessary technical details, scenarios, and edge cases, providing sufficient examples or references.

**Structure and Organization**: For longer answers, answers are logically organized with clear sections, headings, and transitions between ideas. The structure enhances understanding.

**Use of Examples and Diagrams**: Uses well-chosen examples, diagrams, or code snippets (when appropriate) that significantly aid understanding and clarify complex concepts.

**Accuracy**: The content is technically correct and adheres to current best practices and standards.

**Conciseness**: The communication is efficient, avoiding unnecessary detail or excessive language, while still being comprehensive.

## Short Response Questions

### Question 1
You are a developer on an e-commerce website (like Amazon.com). Your job is to write code that lets users add items to a shopping cart, adjust the quantities of each item, and see a total of all items.

What data type(s) would you use to represent a shopping cart item to best enable this functionality? 
What data type(s) would you use to represent the entire shopping cart that holds those items to best enable this functionality? 

Provide a code example of a `shoppingCart` with multiple items and explain your decision.

### Answer 1 

Code Example:

```js
const shoppingCart = ?
```

### Question 2

For each of the scenarios below, identify the array higher-order method that would be most appropriate to use:

1. You have an array of car objects that each have a `color` property. You want every car that has a `color` of `red` or `blue`.
2. You have an array of numbers and you want to multiply them all together.
3. You have an array of numbers and you want a copy of the array where each number has been rounded down to the nearest integer.
4. You have an array of generic values and you want to print out each value.

### Answer 2

Scenario 1: `arr.???`
Scenario 2: `arr.???`
Scenario 3: `arr.???`
Scenario 4: `arr.???`

### Question 3

Imagine you are teaching a brand new programmer a brief lesson about **scope**. Your lesson should have the following components:

* A technical definition of scope ("According to MDN, scope is...")
* An analogy ("You can think of scope like ...")
* A short code snippet that demonstrates scope (make sure to wrap it in triple backticks)
* An explanation of your example

For each section, use clear and concise language. Double check spelling and grammar.

### Answer 3

Technical Definition...

Analogy...

```js
// code example goes here
```

Explanation of Example...


### Question 4

Imagine you are teaching a brand new programmer a brief lesson about **pure functions**. Your lesson should have the following components:

* A technical definition of pure functions ("According to MDN, a pure function is...")
* An analogy ("You can think of pure functions like ...")
* A short code snippet that demonstrates a pure function (make sure to wrap it in triple backticks)
* An explanation of your example

For each section, use clear and concise language. Double check spelling and grammar.

### Answer 4


### Question 5 
Please explain what "Pass By Reference" means. Why must JavaScript developers be aware of this, particularly for functions that accept Arrays/Objects as inputs?

### Answer 5
