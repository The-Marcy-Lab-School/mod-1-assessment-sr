# Mod 1 Assessment!

## Before You Start

Hello and welcome to the Mod 1 Assessment! Before we continue, we want to ground you in the fact that the goal of this assignment is to help *you*. This is not about grades, it's about finding out what you know and if you still need help in some areas. Attempt as *many* questions as you can, some code is always better than no code!

Whenever you take an assessment, you may be flustered. The first step is to count 15 seconds. This feels *unbearably* long in the moment and a waste of precious time! But remember, you have thousands and thousands of seconds. You know how each one felt like forever? Then that means you have a ton of time to work. Breathe in and let the adrenaline rush hit you, and then let it subside so you can *focus*.

We recommend reading over all prompts before your start working. There may be things you know right off the bat, and filling them out first can help you feel more confident. Nothing here is linear, and everything can be done in whatever order you prefer.

Some other helpful things:

- This is open book, open note, open documentation, open console. Use your resources (not AI).
- If you're not sure what a question is asking, reach out to an instructor.
- DO NOT DWELL ON ANY SINGLE QUESTION. If you're stuck, move on and come back to it later.

Good luck everyone!

## Short Responses

Every short response question will be given a score from 0-3 using the following scoring system:

* 0 — Did not attempt the question
* 1 — Attempted the question and the response is more wrong than right, or parts of the question are not fully answered, or the answer is lacking in clarity. Examples and/or diagrams are missing (when required).
* 2 — Attempted the question and all parts of the question are answered, but there are some mistakes and/or the clarity could be improved. Examples and/or diagrams may be missing or could be improved.
* 3 — Answered the question correctly and completely. The response is clear and concise. Examples and/or diagrams are well-chosen and enhance the response.

We understand that typos and grammar mistakes can happen, however, you will also lose .5 points on any the question where typos or grammar errors are "distracting". Distracting meaning that if you saw this on the job, it would have to be retyped for clarification or for the sake of presentation.
